\section{Tuple Expressions}
\seclabel{tuple-expr}

\begin{Grammar}
\emph{TupleExpr} &::=& \texttt( (\emph{Expr}\EXP{,})$^+$ \emph{Expr} \texttt)\\
\end{Grammar}

A tuple expression is an ordered sequence of expressions separated by commas
and enclosed in parentheses.  There must be at least two element expressions.
The type of a tuple expression
is a tuple type (as discussed in \secref{tuple-types}).
Each element of a tuple is evaluated in parallel in a separate implicit thread (see
\secref{threads-parallelism}).
