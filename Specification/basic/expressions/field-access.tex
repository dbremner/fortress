\section{Dotted Field Accesses}
\seclabel{field-access}

\begin{Grammar}
\emph{Primary} &::=& \emph{Primary}\EXP{.}\emph{Id}\\
\end{Grammar}

An expression consisting of a single subexpression (called the
\emph{receiver expression}), followed by `\txt{.}', followed by an
identifier, not immediately followed by a parenthesis or a white
square bracket, is a
\emph{field access}.
The receiver expression must denote an object
(called the \emph{receiver}) and the field access is evaluated to a call
to a getter mapped from that identifier by the receiver.
The type of the field access is the return type of its getter.
The static type of
the receiver indicates whether a getter mapped from that identifier is
provided by the denoted object.  If a getter is not provided, it is a
static error.  See \secref{methods} for a discussion of getters.
The evaluation of the receiver must complete normally before the body of
the getter is evaluated.
