\section{Identifier References}
\seclabel{idn-ref}

\begin{Grammar}
\emph{Primary}
&::=& \emph{VarOrFnRef}\\
&$|$& \KWD{self} \\

\emph{VarOrFnRef} &::=& \emph{Id} \option{\emph{StaticArgs}}\\

\end{Grammar}

A name that is not an operator appearing in an expression context is called
  an \emph{identifier reference}.
It evaluates to the value of the name in the enclosing scope in the value
  namespace.  The type of an identifier reference is the declared type of
  the name.
See \chapref{names} for a discussion of names.
An identifier reference performs a memory read operation.
Note in particular that if a name is not in scope,
it is a static error (as described in \secref{shadowing}).

An identifier reference which denotes a polymorphic function
may include explicit static arguments
(described in \chapref{functions})
but most identifier references do not include them.; the static arguments
are statically inferred from the context of the function call
(as described in \chapref{type-inference}).
For example,
%double[\String\]
\EXP{\VAR{double}\llbracket\TYP{String}\rrbracket} is an identifier
reference with an explicit static argument where the function
\VAR{double} is defined as follows:
\input{\home/basic/examples/Expr.VarRef.tex}

The special name \KWD{self} is declared as a parameter of a method.
When a dotted method is invoked, its receiver is bound to
the \KWD{self} parameter; the value of \KWD{self} is the receiver.
When a functional method is invoked, the corresponding argument is bound to
the \KWD{self} parameter; the value of \KWD{self} is the argument passed to it.
The type of \KWD{self} is the type of the trait or object being declared by
the innermost enclosing trait or object declaration or object expression.
% The new self-type idiom
If the innermost enclosing such construct is a trait declaration (for a trait called,
say, `\EXP{T}'), and that trait declaration has a \KWD{comprises} clause,
and `\EXP{U_1}', `\EXP{U_2}', ..., `\EXP{U_n}' are the traits mentioned in
the \KWD{comprises} clause, then the type of \KWD{self} is instead
``\EXP{T \cap (U_{\mathrm{1}} \cup U_{\mathrm{2}}
\cup \ldots \cup U_{\mathrm{n}})}''.
%
See \secref{methods} for details about \KWD{self} parameters.
