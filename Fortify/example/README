I wrote this example for people that just want to try the tool without having a preexisting document.

I used the fortify tool to generate latex for the run method in buffons.fss.

I added the following header:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fortify}

\begin{document}

and the following footer:


\end{document}

and saved the file in buffons.tex.  

I copied ../fortify.sty to this directory and then ran pdflatex on buffons.tex to generate buffons.pdf.
