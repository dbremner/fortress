(* Tennis Ranking System
   1. Read the ranking result of the previous term.
   2. Read the game results played in this term.
   3. Calculate the new ranking result for this term.
   4. Write the new ranking result, MVPs, MEPs, and MIPs of this term.
      Each line of the ranking result includes:
        the ranking,
        the player's name,
        the number of games won and lost in the season so far,
        the number of games won and lost in this term,
        the number of games played in the season so far,
        the number of games played in this term,
        the points earned in the season so far, and
        the points earned in this term.
      MVP (Most Valuable  Player): who earned the most points
      MEP (Most Energetic Player): who played the most games
      MIP (Most Improved  Player): who rose   the most ranks
 *)
(*
   Rules to calculuate the ranking
   1. Every player begins with 1000 points at the very beginng of the season.
   2. A new term starts in 2 weeks.
   3. Existing members who have not played any games yet are not included in
      the ranking system.
   4. New members can join the system any time.
   5. A game is either a singles game or a doubles game.
   6. If the ranking difference between the two teams is bigger than 10,
      the game is considered invalid; it is not considered when the points are
      calculated.
   7. For each singles game, the players get the following points:
      winner: 10 (winner's ranking - loser's ranking) + 100
      loser :  5 (loser's ranking - winner's ranking) -  50
   8. For each doubles game, the players get the following points:
      winners: 5 (sum of winners' rankings - sum of losers' rankings) + 100
      losers : diff = sum of winners' rankings - sum of losers' rankings
               if diff > 0 OR even(diff)
               then -5 (diff DIV 2)   - 50
               else -5 (diff DIV 2)+1 - 50
   9. if any player has never played any game before this term,
      then ranking differences are ignored.
  10. If the same teams play more than once with the same combination in a term,
      only the first game is considered valid.
  11. If a player does not play any game in a term, the player gets -50 penalties.
