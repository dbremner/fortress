* fix ellipses levels instead of hard coding level 1 for all lists( phases/Transform.java )
* make sure ellipses notation( ** ) works for all relevant nodes. be sure not to only allow ellipses in the template parser, not the regular parser
* aggressively cache template parsers generated by Rats!
* add list constructors as pattern actions: cons-left, cons-right, append, reverse
* add more pattern matching constructors in syntax case expressions
