(** Finger trees, based on Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson's article, JFP
    16:2 2006.

    Why finger trees?  They're balanced and support nearly any
    operation we care to think of in optimal asymptotic time and
    space.  The code is niggly due to lots of cases, but fast in
    practice.

    It's also a trial for encoding type-based invariants in Fortress.
    Can we represent "array of size at most n"?  Not yet, but we ought
    to be able to do so.  This involves questions about the encoding
    of existentials, especially constrained existentials.

(** Generic list trait.
    We return a Generator for non-List-specific operations for which
    reuse of the Generator won't increase asymptotic complexity, but
    return a List in cases (such as map and filter) where it will.
