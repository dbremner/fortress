(* This should pass because overloading uses different numbers of arguments,
   even though there is no type.  This requires the interpreter to be
   careful about how it treats type-info-less 1-argument functions,
   which can match tuples of arguments (but an explicit tuple of
   arguments should count as more specific). *)
