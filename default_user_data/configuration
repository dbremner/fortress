# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE; copy modifications to fortress.properties.local,
# or set per-user properties in $HOME/.fortress.properties, 
# or set per-directory properties in .fortress.properties. 
# Properties can also be specified as environment variables 
# (replacing lower.case with UPPER_CASE). They can also be specified at the
# command line. For example:
#
# fortress run somefile.fss
# 
#
_fr=${FORTRESS_AUTOHOME}/ProjectFortress
# 
# Note the reference to _fr itself, to allow pickup of FortressLibrary.fss
# 
# FORTRESS_AUTOHOME is set by consulting (in order):
#   property fortress.autohome
#   environment FORTRESS_AUTOHOME
#   the existence of ../ProjectFortress from java.class.path (add /..)
#   the existence of ../../ProjectFortress/build on java.class.path (add /../..)
# 
# Note the prefix ";" -- that sets the separator for this path to ";", which works
# on Windows.  ":" fails in Windows because of DRIVE: prefixes.
