These files are associated with measuring community activity.
All this info is publicly available, though some of it is tedious
to collect.  Please don't use the information here to game the system.

1) 

SvnStats.tgz contains tar-gzipped per-commit line information (adds, deletes).
This information is obtained, slowly, by running (and it is slow)
  bin/svnlines START END
in the top level directory.  START END are revision numbers;
information will be obtained for START through END, inclusive.

2)

ExternalContributors.ods is a spreadsheet using that information to compute the
"external lines committed" metric.  Rows to add are obtained by running

  svn log | awk -f bin/svnmetric.awk > scratch.txt

and copying and pasting the appropriate (new) lines from scratch.txt.
External commiters need to be identified by hand, and added as columns
to the appropriate part of the spread sheet.  Add in the middle, and the
lines-if-external code to the right will be updated properly.

(Well, sort of.  It didn't work like this last time I tried it.)

3) 

Scrape (by hand) member lists from majordomo and trac, save those in some
directory D, with names
  trac, announce, implementation, language
then run (in this directory)

  ./member_metrics D
  
It will created D/all.sorted, which contains the cleaned list of external
members.
